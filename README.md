# Discussion

This example app shows how to perform a scene transition between two Activities which goes beyond the normal simple case.

See blog for discussion:

[Part One](http://innodroid.com/blog/post/a-complex-activity-transition-part-1) discusses the problem and setup for the solution.

[Part Two](http://innodroid.com/blog/post/a-complex-activity-transition-part-2) discusses the code and limitations.

Or get right to it and browse the [activity classes](https://github.com/grennis/ComplexTransitionDemo/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/innodroid/complextransitiondemo/ui).
